## Overview

How does Twitter have different pages for each of its 300 million users? How can AirBnB support over 40 million guests with over 1.5 million listings worldwide? All of this is possible because of web frameworks. Today, we'll be discussing Sinatra, a light but powerful web framework written in Ruby. 

## What is Sinatra?

Sinatra is a Domain Specific Language, or DSL, used for writing web applications. It was created by [Blake Mizerany](https://github.com/bmizerany) with the goal of creating applications quickly. Unlike Ruby on Rails, which encourages certain patterns and "convention over configuration", Sinatra is designed to be a flexible way to create web applications. It's used by companies such as Apple, BBC, GitHub, and LinkedIn. 

Essentially, Sinatra is nothing more than some pre-written methods that we can use in our applications. By using these methods, we can create our own web apps quickly and easily. 

Although it's lightweight, Sinatra can be extended with other gems to build out full-featured web applications, including databases.
