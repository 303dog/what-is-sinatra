# What is Sinatra?

## Outline

1. Sinatra is a framework written in Ruby for creating dynamic web applications
2. Explain the difference between a website and a web application
3. List some examples of companies and web applications that use Sinatra
4. Explain that web frameworks allow us to setup applications quickly by adhering to certain conventions

## Overview

How does Twitter have different pages for each of its 300 million users? How can AirBnB support over 40 million guests with over 1.5 million listings worldwide? All of this is possible because of web frameworks. Today, we'll be discussing Sinatra, a light but powerful web framework written in Ruby. 

## What's a Web Framework?

"A web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development." - From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework)

What does this mean? In a nutshell, a web framework is a set of predefined patterns, conventions, and/or functions that make it easier to create a dynamic web application. For example, rather than rewriting the necessary code to create a web server, we can use a framework to create our server for us. By following certain conventions, we can create powerful web applications much faster than if we had to write all of that code ourselves. 

## What is Sinatra?

Sinatra is a Domain Specific Language, or DSL, used for writing web applications. It was created by [Blake Mizerany](https://github.com/bmizerany). Unlike Ruby on Rails, which encourages certain patterns and "convention over configuration", Sinatra is designed to be lightweight and flexible. It's used by companies such as Apple, BBC, GitHub, and LinkedIn. 

Essentially, Sinatra is nothing more than some pre-written methods that we can include in our applications. We love it because although it's lightweight, Sinatra can be extended with other gems to build out full-featured web applications, including databases. It's a great way to learn about the web and will prepare you well for learning other, larger frameworks.
